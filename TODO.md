# TODO

Some ideas for things that could be added:

- Add an option to limit the tweets from a certain date forward.
  This would allow for adding the latest tweets via cron.
- Add options for how many tweets to retrieve
- Ask user for twitter config on first start, save it out
- Sign each entry with the name of the twitter account
- Series of regex that could be applied.
  This would be a way to make SeinfeldToday dialog get put on their own lines.
